Mandatory :

Package/Folder : Test classes Path should same as Feature path, file name can be different

Test Runner class : maven(probably gradle too) need to have the runner class named <anything>Test
 if you rename, locally you can run using IDE plugins but maven will not work
 (i think some maven parameter should be there for commandline)-maven surfire run test suffix class.

This is a very small class that only defines that it should be executed by a JUnit runner that invokes Cucumber,
The class name ends with Test. This means that the Surefire plugin in Maven will be able to pick it up and execute it.
The feature file must be located in the same package as the runner.
Cucumber will examine its classpath and search for all files with the suffix .feature and execute any scenarios it can find.

all stp definations should be same package as test runner

Best practices :
as all step defination method names are cucumber entry, all names should be unique .
So, better use single God Like class to prevent duplicacy during test creation.
And , all features in same package


RUN : mvn test
