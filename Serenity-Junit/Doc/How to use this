Step definition :
1. your stes class must extends ScenarioSteps//net.thucydides.core.steps.ScenarioSteps
2. All step method(public, non static)  should be annotated with @Step//net.thucydides.core.annotations.Step;
3. if you keep a superclass for all steps in your project, make sure that super class extends ScenarioSteps
4. Step defination class may contains multiple pages, make sure those are following page object.
The target is, all of those pages should maintain common session. If you need to make a new session, you have to define seperately.


Best practice :( i follow)
1. have assertions for each step
    Expected data
    Expected item validation
