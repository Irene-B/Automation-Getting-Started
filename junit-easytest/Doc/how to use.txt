Important Annotation :


1. DataLoader => Loades data from Excel, CSV, XML
Can not use different type of file in same annotation
One file ignore if multiple same type file loading data.

Usages :
1. With Test, loads data for test
2. With class, default data loader for all tests in the class
3. With policy class, can be used as global test parameter





Does not work :
@Duration => makes tests tobe ignored.
@Report for failed tests with CSV & XML
@TestProperties at class level

Not in the example :
=> Custom type
And following annotations :
 Converters
 TestConfigProvider
 Intercept
 PreerveContext
 Provided
 TestBean
