Important Annotation :


1. DataLoader => Loades data from Excel, CSV, XML
Can not use different type of file in same annotation
One file ignore if multiple same type file loading data.



Does not work :
@Duration => makes tests tobe ignored.
@Report for failed tests with CSV & XML
@TestProperties at class level

Not in the example :
=> Custom type
And following annotations :
 Converters
 TestConfigProvider
 Intercept
 PreerveContext
 Provided
 TestBean
