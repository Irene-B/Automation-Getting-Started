Important Annotation :


1. DataLoader => Loades data from Excel, CSV, XML
Can not use different type of file in same annotation
One file ignore if multiple same type file loading data.

Usages :
1. With Test, loads data for test
2. With class, default data loader for all tests in the class
3. With policy class, can be used as global test parameter

I prefer, 1 test = 1 data loader to keep it more specific and error free.

Limitations :
1. Runwith DataDrivenTestRunner.class or BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.class
2. Only one loade of a type should be in a test class (if you have two XML file loaders, you may see errors)

Note :
Easy test exceptions are not very much user friendly so, you may struggle to get the root cause. so, be target oriented from start and follow own rules.

So, make it before use

important note : if assertion fails, CSV & XML reports are not generated but works fine with Excel

Does not work :
@Duration => makes tests tobe ignored.
@Report for failed tests with CSV & XML
